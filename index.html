    <h1>Taarlo</h1>
    <span class="author">by Herman de Coninck</span>
    <p class="content">We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
        And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
        We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
        through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,<br>
        <br>
        that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>
        We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
        Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>
        sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br>
        <br>
        33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
        of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
        at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br>
        <br>
        Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
        The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
        The here is nowhere, and the now is never.
